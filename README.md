# 100 Days of Code with Python

I am challenging myself to code for at least an hour every day in Python for the next 100 days. I will share my progress and learnings on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Aadhithya-D).

## Motivation

My goal is to improve my Python skills and knowledge and to become a better programmer overall. By committing to code daily, I plan to form a consistent learning and growth habit.

## Rules

* Code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
* Share my progress daily on GitHub.
* Use Python for at least an hour each day.
* Complete a project or learn a new concept each week.

## Progress

I will update my progress daily on GitHub: GitHub: https://github.com/Adithya-Sakaray/100-Days-of-Code-Python. You can follow along to see what I'm working on and what I'm learning.

## Conclusion

I am excited to start this 100-day code challenge with Python, and I hope to come out of it as a better programmer.

## In simpler terms:

I'm going to code in Python for 1 hour every day for the next 100 days. I'll share my progress on GitHub so you can follow along. I want to become a better programmer, and this is my way of doing it.
